# FTL-freebsd-port
FreeBSD ports of `pihole-FTL` & `AdminLTE` based on the freebsd branches of theese repo:

 - https://github.com/exeba/FTL
 - https://github.com/exeba/AdminLTE

They can be built and installed runnig `make install` as for regular FreeBSD ports.
Some dependencies needs to be fixed (i.e. you need to install then manually):
 - `bash`, `sqlite3`, `bind-tools` for `FTL`
 - php extensions used by `AdminLTE`

Help & feedback is very welcome!
